//Create a Person class in Swift with the following functionality:
//Properties for a personâ€™s first name and last name and a bool declaring if the person is a student or not

//An init method that takes in 3 parameters that are used to set each property on the person.

//A method that returns the persons full name (the first name and last name combined!)
